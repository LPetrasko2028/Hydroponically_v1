# Nutrient Delivery Strategy

TDS Sensor does not measure individual nutrients, but the total amount of nutrients in the water.

## Ideas

### 1. Deliver nutrients in increments of the correct ratio until the TDS reaches a certain level
- This is the simplest and most straightforward way to deliver nutrients to the plants.
- The TDS sensor will be used to measure the TDS level and the nutrient delivery will be based on the TDS level.

### 2. Buy sensors for each nutrient and deliver them individually
- This comes at a significantly higher price tag, but it will allow for more precise measurements and delivery of nutrients.
- This may be beneficial for plants that are sensitive to certain nutrients, but for the most part, it will be a waste of money.
