# Contexts and Global Variables

The ideal component would be self contained and not rely on any global variables. However, global variables are necessary to be able to implement some of the features.

## How

### Contexts - React

### Zustand

## Examples

### 1. Authentication and User Data

User data needs to be used in multiple places. The root for authentication and profile for viewing and changing user data. This is a good example of the requirement for a global variable.

### 2. Preferences (Appearance and Accessibility Features)

Appearance and Accessibility features need to be loaded on app startup and be able to be changed by the user in the profile page.
