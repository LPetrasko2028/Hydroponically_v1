# Hydroponically Power Needs

## Raspberry Pi / Control Circuit
- 1 outlet for the raspberry pi. This provides a 15v power supply for the control circuit.

## Power / Work Circuit
- 1 outlet for the water pump circuit (timed circuit 1)
    - 1 outlet for the water pump
    - Maybe 1 outlet for the peristaltic pump circuit if it cannot be powered by the control circuit. Each peristaltic pump is 12v and 5w.
- 1 outlet for the lighting circuit (timed circuit 2)
    - 1 outlet per LED light array for the lighting

## Mains Power
- 3 outlets total for the mains power

## Plan 

- [ ] Complete the water pump circuit with the **POWER STRIP** and a **RELAY** to turn it on and off.
- [ ] Complete the lighting circuit with the **POWER STRIP** and a **RELAY** to turn it on and off.
- [ ] Complete the peristaltic pump circuit with the **POWER STRIP** and a **RELAY** to turn it on and off, If needed.
