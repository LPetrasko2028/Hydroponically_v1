# Tower Design

Here is the rough draft and planning for the tower design.

## Designs in consideration

First considerations:
- Plant density
- Ease of access
- Integration with existing products (grow tent sizing, etc)
- Camera monitoring
- Cost
- Injection molding requirements
- Avoiding copyright / existing designs
- Material (Safety, durability, cost, etc)

Secondary considerations:
- Plant size
- Plant shape
- Plant orientation
- Plant positioning

## Goals

1. Tower design that is easy to build and maintain (clean and replace parts)
2. Tower design that is easy to access: users and camera monitoring
3. Material that is safe and durable: **HDPE** - used in food packaging and is durable and safe
4. Can be **injection molded** (âœ… HDPE) - benefits: 
    - Cheap and easy for packaging and shipping to customers
    - Easy to install and maintain
    - Easy to replace parts
5. Tower fits in most (5' x 5') grow tents

## Design 1 - Prototype - PVC Tower

This is the first prototype design. It is a 4" diameter PVC pipe with angled holes that allow plant pods to be inserted. The holes are made by making a slit and then heating and warping the slit into an angled hole that prevents water from leaking out.

The PVC pipe allows the utilization of 360 degrees around the tower. However this is both a benefit and a drawback.

Benefits:
- Space utilization per unit of material
- Cheap ish 

Drawbacks:
- Not as easy to access as other designs ( have to access all sides of the pipe )
- Not as easy to replace parts
- Harder to use grow lights

Specifications:
- 26 plant pods spaces
- Material: PVC
    - PVC comes with warnings of carcinogens and reproductive harm
    - Goal is to move away from PVC
- Cost: $20 - $30 USD


## Design 2 - Prototype - HDPE Wall Tower

An HDPE wall tower will be separated into injection molded parts than can be assembled. The wall will either have one side for growing or two. 

One side:

Benefits:
- Ease of access (users and cameras)
- Easy to replace parts
- More material than Design 1, however could use thinner walls to save material
- Easy to use grow lights

Drawbacks:
- More material than Design 1
- Harder to disperse water around the tower evenly
