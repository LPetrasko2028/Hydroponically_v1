# Circuit Safety

This is a list of things to consider when designing a circuit safely.

## Things to consider

1. Voltage
2. Current
3. Resistance
4. Temperature
5. Fuses
6. Insulation
7. Electrical Noise

## From Claude (AI)
1. Isolation and Insulation


    - Use properly rated relays with adequate isolation between control and power circuits
    - Ensure voltage ratings of all components exceed 120V AC by a safe margin (typically 2-3x)
    - Use appropriate insulation and spacing between high and low voltage sections
    - Consider using optically isolated relay modules for added safety


2. Protection Mechanisms


    - Install appropriate fuses or circuit breakers rated for the expected load
    - Include transient voltage suppression (MOVs, TVS diodes) to protect from surges
    - Use snubber circuits across relay contacts to reduce arcing
    - Consider adding emergency stop functionality


3. Grounding and Enclosure


    - Proper grounding of all metal components and enclosures
    - Use a suitable NEMA-rated enclosure to prevent accidental contact
    - Include strain relief for all cable entries
    - Clearly mark high voltage warnings on enclosure


4. Component Selection


    - Use UL listed or similarly certified components
    - Select relays with appropriate current ratings (include safety margin)
    - Consider relay contact material suitable for AC switching
    - Use proper wire gauge rated for the current


5. Layout Considerations


    - Maintain adequate clearance between high and low voltage sections
    - Route control and power wiring separately
    - Include proper ventilation if needed
    - Make all connections in proper junction boxes
